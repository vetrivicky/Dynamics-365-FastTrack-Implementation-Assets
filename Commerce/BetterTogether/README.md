# Scenario details:

![Better Together Customer Experience Flow](media/0ff9ed944091e0291773529c179ef311.png)

The Chief Revenue officer (CRO) reviews the sales numbers after the first month of site launch and they are not as high as he was expecting. He connects with his sales analyst who leverages the Dynamics Customer Insights tools to dig into the data to understand what could be happening.

Their hypothesis is that the site may not be providing enough detailed information about these products to allow a customer to feel confident in their purchases.

They decide to tackle this challenge with 2 initiatives:

-   Implementing a Power Virtual Agent chatbot on the site which will help customers who are stuck to get to the next level of engagement. Customers can engage with a virtual assistant to get additional product questions answered and get the information they need to make a final purchase.
-   Create a targeted marketing campaign for a segment of customers who fall into a behavior of dwelling but not buying. A marketing journey designed in Dynamics 365 Marketing to send E-commerce site visitors a follow-up email with a 20% off promotion to encourage them to complete their purchase.

With this marketing campaign, sales increased from site visitors who left originally without placing an order. Data showed that a majority of those customers utilized the chatbot before making a purchase.

This showcases how Dynamics 365 Applications - Commerce, Power Virtual Agent, Customer Insights, and Marketing work together seamlessly to provide more personalized shopping experience to e-Commerce customers.

The Chief Revenue Officer is now able to achieve better customer experience and increase conversion rates and revenue.
